# My GitHub Copilot Hackathon Submission: Year Compass - Helping You Achieve Your Goals

_This is a submission for the [GitHub Copilot Challenge ](https://dev.to/challenges/github): New Beginnings_

## What I Built

So, for this hackathon, I decided to build a little web app called "Year Compass." The idea is pretty simple: it helps you actually _achieve_ your New Year's resolutions instead of just making them and forgetting about them by February!

The core of it is taking that big, sometimes vague resolution and using AI to break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Think of it like having a mini AI coach in your browser. You type in your resolution, hit a button, and bam! You get a list of things you can actually _do_.

Here are the main things it does:

- **Easy Resolution Input:** Just a text box to type in your goal.
- **AI-Powered Steps:** Click a button, and the magic happens on the backend to generate those actionable steps.
- **Clear Step Display:** The steps show up in a list, each with a little checkbox.
- **Progress Tracking:** A simple progress bar at the top shows how far you've come. It updates as you check off those steps!
- **Local Saving:** Everything (your resolution, the steps, and your progress) gets saved right in your browser. So when you come back, it's all still there.
- **Little Celebrations:** When you hit certain milestones (like 25%, 50%, etc.), the app gives you a little "Woohoo!" message to keep you going.

Since it's a hackathon and we're focusing on using Copilot, everything is stored locally in the browser. No fancy databases or user accounts for this version! It's all about that "new beginning" vibe, helping people get started and stay motivated with their goals.

## Copilot Experience

Honestly, I leaned on it _heavily_ throughout this whole process. The Copilot Edits feature was a lifesaver. It's really similar to using Aider, but having it integrated right in VS Code with a GUI is just fantastic. It made refactoring and adding new features so much smoother.

For smaller tweaks and quick fixes, the inline chat was also super handy. Instead of sending whole files to Copilot Edits, I could just select a line or two and ask it to make a specific change.

And of course, the autocomplete is still a game-changer. Even though I was relying on Copilot for a lot, there were still times I was writing code from scratch, and the suggestions were incredibly helpful, especially in the early stages of setting things up. I've been using Copilot's autocomplete since it first came out, and it's still a core part of my workflow.

## GitHub Models

Yep, I definitely used GitHub Models for this project! The main place where they came in was for generating those actionable steps from the user's resolution. That's the core AI-powered part of the app. I used the models to take the user's input and turn it into a list of concrete things they could do. So, it wasn't just for prototyping â€“ it's actually a core part of how the app works.

## Conclusion

Overall, this was a really fun and productive hackathon! Building "Year Compass" with Copilot felt like a really streamlined experience. It helped me focus on the logic and the user experience, knowing that I had a powerful AI assistant helping with the coding. I think the idea of breaking down big goals into smaller steps is really powerful, and hopefully, this little app can help people make real progress on their "new beginnings" throughout the year. Thanks for the challenge!
