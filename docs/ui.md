## UI Specification: Year Compass (Hackathon - Local Storage)

This document provides a detailed specification for the user interface of the New Year's Resolution Planner application. It aims to be comprehensive enough for implementation without requiring visual mockups.

**Overall Layout:**

The application will consist of a single page. The content should be vertically stacked and flow logically from top to bottom. Maintain sufficient spacing between sections for clarity. Use a simple, clean font (e.g., sans-serif).

**1. Header (Optional, but Recommended):**

- **Purpose:** To provide a clear title for the application.
- **Element:** `<h1>` heading
- **Text:** "Year Compass" or "New Year's Resolution Planner"
- **Position:** At the very top of the page.
- **Styling:** Use a larger font size to distinguish it as the main title. Keep the styling simple.

**2. Resolution Input Section:**

- **Purpose:** Allows the user to enter their New Year's resolution and trigger AI processing.
- **Elements:**
  - **Label:** `<label>` element
    - **Text:** "My New Year's Resolution:"
    - **For Attribute:** Should correspond to the `id` of the text input field (see below).
    - **Position:** Placed above or to the left of the text input field.
  - **Text Input Field:** `<input type="text">`
    - **ID:** `resolutionInput` (for JavaScript access).
    - **Name:** `resolution` (if a form were used, though we are not using a form submission).
    - **Placeholder Text:** "e.g., Learn to play the guitar" or "Become more organized"
    - **Initial Value:** Empty if no previous resolution is stored in local storage. If a `"currentResolution"` value exists in local storage, populate this field with that value upon page load.
    - **Behavior:** Allows the user to type their resolution.
  - **"Generate Steps" Button:** `<button>` element
    - **ID:** `generateStepsButton` (for JavaScript access).
    - **Text:** "Generate Steps"
    - **Position:** Placed to the right of or below the text input field.
    - **Behavior:**
      - When clicked, retrieve the text value from the `resolutionInput` field.
      - Initiate the AI processing (implementation details of the API call are outside the scope of this UI document, but assume a function or method will handle this).
      - While waiting for the AI response, consider providing visual feedback (e.g., disabling the button and changing its text to "Generating..." or displaying a spinner).
      - Upon receiving the AI-generated steps, proceed to update the "Actionable Steps" section (see below).

**3. Actionable Steps Display Section:**

- **Purpose:** To display the list of actionable steps generated by the AI.
- **Element:** `<ol>` (ordered list)
  - **ID:** `stepsList` (for JavaScript access).
  - **Position:** Below the "Resolution Input" section.
  - **Initial State:** Empty or populated with steps from local storage (if `"resolutionSteps"` exists).
  - **Dynamic Updates:**
    - When the "Generate Steps" button is clicked and the AI returns steps, dynamically create `<li>` (list item) elements within this `<ol>`.
    - For each step received from the AI:
      - Create an `<li>` element.
      - Inside each `<li>`, create:
        - **Checkbox:** `<input type="checkbox">`
          - **ID:** A unique ID for each checkbox, potentially based on the step index (e.g., `stepCheckbox-0`, `stepCheckbox-1`, etc.) for easy JavaScript manipulation.
          - **Name:** Can be the same for all (e.g., `step`).
          - **Initial State:** Unchecked. If the corresponding step in local storage has `isCompleted: true`, set the checkbox to checked upon page load or when loading steps.
          - **Event Listener:** Attach an event listener to each checkbox. When a checkbox is clicked:
            - Update the `isCompleted` status of the corresponding step in the local storage `"resolutionSteps"` array.
            - Trigger the update of the progress bar (see below).
        - **Step Text:** A `<span>` or plain text node to display the actual step text.
          - **Content:** The text of the actionable step received from the AI.
          - **Position:** Placed to the right of the checkbox.
- **Local Storage Interaction:** Upon page load, if `"resolutionSteps"` exists in local storage, iterate through the array and dynamically create the list items and checkboxes, setting the checked state based on the `isCompleted` property.

**4. Progress Bar Section:**

- **Purpose:** To visually represent the completion progress of the resolution.
- **Elements:**
  - **Label (Optional):** A `<label>` or `<span>` element
    - **Text:** "Progress:" or similar.
    - **Position:** Above or to the left of the progress bar.
  - **Progress Bar Container:** `<div>` element
    - **ID:** `progressBarContainer` (for styling and potential JavaScript access).
    - **Styling:** Set a width (e.g., 200px), height (e.g., 15px), and background color (e.g., light grey). Add rounded corners for visual appeal.
  - **Progress Bar Fill:** `<div>` element (nested within the `progressBarContainer`)
    - **ID:** `progressBarFill` (for JavaScript access to control width).
    - **Styling:**
      - Set the height to match the container.
      - Set a background color (e.g., a shade of blue or green).
      - **Initial Width:** Calculated based on the initial completion status from local storage (if steps exist). If no steps or all are incomplete, the width should be 0%.
    - **Dynamic Updates:**
      - Whenever a checkbox in the "Actionable Steps" section is checked or unchecked:
        - Calculate the new completion percentage: `(Number of completed steps / Total number of steps) * 100`.
        - Update the `width` style of the `progressBarFill` element to reflect the calculated percentage. For example, if the percentage is 50%, set `progressBarFill.style.width = '50%';`.
      - **Percentage Display (Optional but Recommended):** A `<span>` element placed next to or inside the progress bar to display the numerical percentage (e.g., "50%"). Update this dynamically alongside the progress bar fill.

**5. Reminder Note Section:**

- **Purpose:** Allows the user to add a manual reminder related to their resolution.
- **Elements:**
  - **Label:** `<label>` element
    - **Text:** "Reminder Note (Optional):"
    - **For Attribute:** Should correspond to the `id` of the text area (see below).
    - **Position:** Above the text area.
  - **Text Area:** `<textarea>` element
    - **ID:** `reminderNote` (for JavaScript access).
    - **Name:** `reminder` (if a form were used).
    - **Rows:** A suitable number of rows (e.g., 3 or 4) to provide enough space for the note.
    - **Placeholder Text:** "e.g., Remember to schedule time each week for practice."
    - **Initial Value:** If a `"reminderNote"` value exists in local storage, populate this text area with that value upon page load.
    - **Event Listener:** Attach an event listener (e.g., `input` or `change`) to the text area. When the content of the text area changes:
      - Save the current value of the text area to local storage under the key `"reminderNote"`.

**6. Milestone Celebration Messages:**

- **Purpose:** To provide positive feedback and encouragement to the user.
- **Mechanism:** Display messages dynamically based on the progress percentage.
- **Triggering Conditions:**
  - **25% Completion:** When the progress bar reaches 25%.
  - **50% Completion:** When the progress bar reaches 50%.
  - **75% Completion:** When the progress bar reaches 75%.
  - **100% Completion:** When the progress bar reaches 100%.
- **Display Method:** A simple way to display the message is to:
  - Use a `<div>` or `<span>` element with an ID (e.g., `milestoneMessage`).
  - Initially, this element can be hidden or empty.
  - When a milestone is reached, update the text content of this element with the appropriate message and make it visible (if initially hidden).
  - **Messages:**
    - 25%: "Great job, you're 25% there!"
    - 50%: "Halfway there! Keep going!"
    - 75%: "Almost there! You're doing great!"
    - 100%: "Congratulations! You did it!"
- **Position:** Place this message element near the progress bar (e.g., below or to the side).
- **Persistence:** The milestone message does not need to persist after the user navigates away or refreshes the page (as it's based on real-time progress).

**Local Storage Keys (Reference):**

- `"currentResolution"`: Stores the text of the current resolution (String).
- `"resolutionSteps"`: Stores a JSON string representing an array of step objects. Each step object has:
  - `text`: The step text (String).
  - `isCompleted`: Boolean indicating completion status.
- `"reminderNote"`: Stores the text of the manual reminder note (String).

**Accessibility Considerations:**

- **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `<h1>` for the main heading, `<label>` for form labels, `<button>` for buttons, `<ol>` and `<li>` for lists). This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and content of the page.

- **Form Labels:** Ensure all form controls (`<input type="text">`, `<textarea>`) have associated `<label>` elements using the `for` attribute that matches the `id` of the form control. This is crucial for screen reader users to understand the purpose of each input field.

- **Keyboard Navigation:**

  - Ensure all interactive elements (text input, button, checkboxes, text area) are focusable using the keyboard (Tab key). The focus order should be logical and follow the visual flow of the page.
  - Interactive elements should have a clear visual focus indicator when they are focused (e.g., a border or outline). This helps users who navigate with the keyboard see which element is currently active.
  - Checkboxes should be toggleable using the Spacebar key when focused.

- **ARIA Attributes (if necessary):**

  - For the progress bar, use ARIA attributes to convey its role, current value, and maximum value to assistive technologies.
    - `role="progressbar"` on the `progressBarContainer` or a parent element.
    - `aria-valuenow`: Set dynamically to the current progress percentage (numeric value).
    - `aria-valuemin="0"`
    - `aria-valuemax="100"`
  - If the milestone messages are implemented as dynamically shown/hidden elements, consider using `aria-live="polite"` or `aria-live="assertive"` on the container of the message to announce updates to screen reader users. `polite` will wait until the user is idle, while `assertive` will interrupt the user. Choose based on the importance and urgency of the message.

- **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background colors to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. This is important for users with low vision. Use a contrast checker tool to verify.

- **Clear and Concise Text:** Use clear and concise language for labels, instructions, and any other text content on the page.

- **Error Handling (Basic):** Although not explicitly part of the core features, if the AI step generation could potentially fail, provide a clear and informative error message to the user, explaining what went wrong and what they can do.

- **Responsive Design (Basic):** While a detailed responsive design isn't required for this hackathon, ensure the layout is reasonably usable on different screen sizes without horizontal scrolling where possible. Use viewport meta tag: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

By incorporating these accessibility considerations, the application will be more usable for a wider range of users, including those with disabilities.
